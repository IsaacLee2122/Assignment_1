//Isaac Lee, Exercise 8: Starting from the solution of the previous exercise, create an additional method in
//the Square and Rectangle classes, called getDetails(), which returns the same
//string that was printed in the printDetails() method. After creating it, make sure that the
//printDetails() method takes advantage of the getDetails() method so as not to duplicate
//the code. Create a class called TestQuadrilaters that prints the details of a square and a rectangle.
